   <h1>Main Idea</h1> <br>
 Ramsey theorem states that when we use two-colours to colour the edges in K6, any edge colouring of it would yield a monochromatic triangle.Similarly, in K8 and K9 two-colouring
 (red and blue) would yield a red K4 or a blue K3. <br> Idea is to use this fact and implement a game where 2 players would represent a unique colour each and in a round-robin turn pattern, they will colour an edge during their turn. The person who will complete a Monochromatic triangle loses.<br>
 <h1>Goal</h1>
The name “Deadly-Trio” represents the monochromatic triangle, where according to the rule of the game the player who completes the monochromatic triangle loses. Hence, The plan is to develop a 2-player game that consists of three levels, K6, K8 , and K9 which represents easy medium, and hard modes respectively.

<br>Each player will have their own unique colour and on their turn, they have to draw a line between the vertices. According to Ramsey Theorem when we 2-colour K8 , and K9either a monochromatic K3 or K4or similar colour will form. The goal is to avoid a monochromatic triangle or to form a monochromatic square. The player who created a monochromatic triangle loses, or the player who completes monochromatic square first wins.

  <h1>Rules to Play</h1>
<h3>
 The Player needs to choose from the various different levels easy, moderate and hard. <br> Easy represents K6, Moderate represents K7 and Hard represents K8. <br>
Then the player starts the game.<br>
First player   ------>  	BLUE <br>
Second player  ------> 	RED <br>

On turn each player has to draw a line between the vertices to make a complete graph avoiding a monochromatic triangle.<br>
The player who is left with no choice other than completing a triangle loses.<br>
The Game will consist of several rounds and scores from each round will be added to the scoreboard.<br>
The player with the maximun score wins.
