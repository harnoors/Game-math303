    <h2 id="details">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ramsey theorem states that when we use 2-colours to colour the edges in K6, any edge colouring of
          it would yield a monochromatic triangle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any complete graph of vertices more than 6 also yields a monochromatic triangle as R(3,3)=6. Therefore, a
          2-colouring of K8 and K10 yields a monochromatic triangle.
        </li>

      <ul>
        <li>The name “Deadly-Trio” represents the monochromatic triangle.</li>
        <li>The plan was to develop a 2-player game that consists of three diffrent levels K6, K8, and K10 which
          represents Easy, Medium, and Hard modes respectively.</li>
        <li>Each player will have their own unique colour and on their turn, they have to draw a line between two
          vertices.</li>
        <li>According to the rule of the game the player who completes the monochromatic triangle loses.</li>
      </ul>

    <h1 id="heading">Rules to Play</h1>
    <h2 id="details">
      <ul>
        <li>Initally, The Players needs to choose one from the various different levels.<br>
        <li>Each player will represent a unique color. Where,
          <br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>First player ------> <p id="blue">BLUE</p> <br></li><br>
            <li>Second player ------> <p id="red">RED</p> <br></li><br>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <li>On turn each player has to draw a line between two vertices to make a complete graph avoiding a monochromatic
        triangle.<br></li>
      <li>The player who completes the monochromatic triangle loses.</li>
      <ul>
        <br>
        <li>NOTE: According to Ramsey Theorem, There will be a player who will be left with no choice other than
          completing a triangle.<br></li>
